   *  checkForVirus: 10 :      16:00:36 CET 2014
   *
   * Look at the seconds. Seems that the hash and check methods runs not in parallel, but sequential.
   * What happened? Because the for comprehension is only syntactic sugar for flatMap and map the calculations performs:

     loadResourceStream("test.txt").flatMap{stream =>
       calculateSHA1(stream).map { hash =>
         checkForVirus(stream).map { containsVirus =>
           ResourceInfo(stream.mkString, hash, containsVirus)
         }
       }
     }

     And there is our failure. Cause the cascaded mapping we perform our methods sequential and therefore perform the futures sequential.
